		<h3>1. Peerio is a Venue</h3>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peerio acts as a venue to allow users who comply with

		transaction between buyers and sellers. Peerio does not pre-screen users or the content
		or information provided by users. Peerio cannot ensure that a buyer or seller will
		actually complete a transaction. Peerio does however ensure that buyers will be
		refunded for items they do not receive.</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peerio does not transfer legal ownership of items from
		the seller to the buyer.</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<h3>3. Fees and Services</h3>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Joining, setting up an account, making an offer on or
		listing an item on Peerio is free. Peerio charges a percentage of the sale price when
		the item sells. When you list an item you have an opportunity to review and accept the
		fees that you will be charged. Peerio's Fees Policy, which is subject to change, is
		incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Changes to the Fees Policy and the fees
		for Peerio's services are effective after Peerio provides you with at least fourteen
		(14) days' notice by posting the changes on the Service. However, Peerio may choose to
		temporarily change the Fees Policy and the fees for Peerio's services for promotional
		events (for example, no fee listing days); such changes are effective when Peerio posts
		the temporary promotional event on the Service. Peerio may, at Peerio's sole
		discretion, change some or all of Peerio's services at any time. In the event Peerio
		introduces a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the
		service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in US Dollars (USD).</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable
		taxes associated with using Peerio. Peerio keeps accepted payment information on
		file.</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fees and Termination: If Peerio terminates a listing or
		your account, if you close your account, or if the payment of your Peerio fees cannot
		be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay Peerio for all unpaid fees
		plus any penalties, if applicable. If the seller's account is not paid in full and
		becomes past due, the seller risks penalties such as the suspension of privileges
		and/or termination of the account and other collection mechanisms (including retaining
		collection agencies and legal counsel). If you have a question or wish to dispute a
		charge, contact Peerio.</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<h3>4. Listing and Selling</h3>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Listing Description: By listing an item on the Service
		you warrant that you and all aspects of the item comply with Peerio's published
		policies. You also warrant that you may legally sell the item. You must accurately
		describe your item and all terms of sale in your Peerio profile. Your listings may only
		include text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other content relevant to the sale of
		that item. All items must be listed in an appropriate category with appropriate tags.
		Each listing must accurately and completely describe the item/items for sale in that
		listing. Each unique item must have its own listing.</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Binding Sale: All sales are binding. The seller is
		obligated to complete the transaction with the buyer in a prompt manner, unless there
		is an exceptional circumstance, such as: (a) the buyer fails to meet the terms of the
		seller's listing (such as payment method), or (b) the seller cannot authenticate the
		buyer's identity. The buyer is obligated to deliver appropriate payment for items
		purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance.</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fee Avoidance: The price stated in each item listing
		description must be an accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may not add
		supplemental charges or fees to the sale price or otherwise avoid fees. You may not
		alter the item's price after a sale for the purpose of avoiding Peerio transaction
		fees, misrepresent the item's location, or use another user's account without
		permission.</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">License: Peerio does not claim ownership rights in your

		<h3>7. Information Control</h3>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peerio does not control the Content provided by users
		that is made available on Peerio. You may find some Content to be offensive, harmful,
		inaccurate, or deceptive. There are also risks of dealing with underage persons or
		people acting under false pretense.</span></p>



		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additionally, there may also be risks dealing with
		international trade and foreign nationals. By using Peerio, you agree to accept such
		risks and that Peerio (and Peerio's officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<h3>8. Meetings</span></h3>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Users may arrange and attend online virtual meetings or
		in-person meetings ("Meetings") with one or more individuals. Users are solely
		responsible for interactions with others. Users must comply with Peerio's policies and
		acknowledge and agree to comply with the laws of the city, county and country in which
		the Meeting occurs.</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peerio does not supervise or control the Meetings,
		user-initiated online or offline gatherings, or the interactions among and between
		users and other persons or companies. Users are solely responsible for interactions
		with others. Users understand that Peerio does not in any way screen its users. All
		users agree to exercise caution and good judgment in all interactions with others,
		particularly if meeting offline or in person.</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<h3>9. Item Receipt and Refunds</span></h3>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All users share the responsibility for making sure that
		purchases facilitated by Peerio are satisfactory and hassle-free.</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Payment: As a buyer, your credit card is charged
		immediately for the full offer amount after filling out the appropriate payment
		information.</span></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class=
		"c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pickup: Buyers have 48 hours to coordinate the pick up
		of the item before the seller may cancel the sale, refunding the purchase price to the
		original payment method. Sellers are responsible for making themselves available to
		buyers to pick up items, within reason, during the times they specified in the pickup
		availability section of the respective item listings.</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Item acceptance: Once both parties agree that the sale
		is complete, the seller may request payment from Peerio, prompting confirmation from
		the buyer that the item has been received and accepted, as-is. A text message
		confirming item acceptance is then sent to the buyer, or the buyer may accept the item
		by confirming receipt in the app. Buyers must inspect the condition of the item and
		ONLY accept the item if it is as described in the item listing. By confirming, the
		buyer agrees to pay the sale amount according to their card issuer agreement. Once an
		item has been accepted, the item may not be returned to the seller and is not eligible
		for refund.</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Refunds: In some cases, buyers and sellers may not be
		able to coordinate the pickup of an item within a reasonable amount of time or, despite
		a seller's positive intentions, some material information may be left out of an item's
		description. If an item is not as described or was not received, buyers should NOT
		accept the item. If an item has already been accepted, only with the seller's express
		consent will a refund be granted. Eligible refunds can be requested in Peerio and will,
		if approved, made by crediting the payment method used.</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<h3>10. Resolution of Disputes and Release</h3>

		please contact Peerio.</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		matter of this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration in San Francisco
		County, California, using the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules

		effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving
		intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the
		appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and
		Procedures of JAMS. The prevailing party in any arbitration or other proceeding arising
		under this Agreement shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable
		expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees and all other
		expenses) incurred in connection therewith. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be
		entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for
		judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.
		Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action
		in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a
		final decision by the arbitrator. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties
		consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts or
		state courts located in the Southern District of New York. Use of the Service is not
		authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the
		Agreement, including without limitation, this section. You and Peerio agree that any
		cause of action arising out of or related to the Service (including, but not limited
		to, any services provided or made available therein) or this Agreement must commence
		within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is
		permanently barred.</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Should you have a dispute with one or more users, or an
		outside party, you release Peerio (and Peerio's officers, directors, agents,
		subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from any and all claims, demands and
		damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown,

		connected with such disputes. Peerio encourages users to report user-to-user disputes
		to your local law enforcement, postmaster general, or a certified mediation or
		arbitration entity, as applicable.</span></p>

		<p class="c1 c2"></p>

		resolve disputes. Peerio does so in Peerio's sole discretion, and Peerio has no

		the extent that Peerio attempts to resolve a dispute, Peerio will do so in good faith
		based solely on Peerio's policies. Peerio will not make judgments regarding legal
		issues or claims.</span></p>
