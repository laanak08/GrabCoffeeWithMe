<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">3. Fees and Services</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Joining, setting up an account, making an offer on or
listing an item on Peerio is free. Peerio charges a percentage of the sale price when
the item sells. When you list an item you have an opportunity to review and accept the
fees that you will be charged. Peerio's Fees Policy, which is subject to change, is
incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Changes to the Fees Policy and the fees
for Peerio's services are effective after Peerio provides you with at least fourteen
(14) days' notice by posting the changes on the Service. However, Peerio may choose to
temporarily change the Fees Policy and the fees for Peerio's services for promotional
events (for example, no fee listing days); such changes are effective when Peerio posts
the temporary promotional event on the Service. Peerio may, at Peerio's sole
discretion, change some or all of Peerio's services at any time. In the event Peerio
introduces a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the
service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in US Dollars (USD).</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable
taxes associated with using Peerio. Peerio keeps accepted payment information on
file.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fees and Termination: If Peerio terminates a listing or
your account, if you close your account, or if the payment of your Peerio fees cannot
be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay Peerio for all unpaid fees
plus any penalties, if applicable. If the seller's account is not paid in full and
becomes past due, the seller risks penalties such as the suspension of privileges
and/or termination of the account and other collection mechanisms (including retaining
collection agencies and legal counsel). If you have a question or wish to dispute a
charge, contact Peerio.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">4. Listing and Selling</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Listing Description: By listing an item on the Service
you warrant that you and all aspects of the item comply with Peerio's published
policies. You also warrant that you may legally sell the item. You must accurately
describe your item and all terms of sale in your Peerio profile. Your listings may only
include text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other content relevant to the sale of
that item. All items must be listed in an appropriate category with appropriate tags.
Each listing must accurately and completely describe the item/items for sale in that
listing. Each unique item must have its own listing.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Binding Sale: All sales are binding. The seller is
obligated to complete the transaction with the buyer in a prompt manner, unless there
is an exceptional circumstance, such as: (a) the buyer fails to meet the terms of the
seller's listing (such as payment method), or (b) the seller cannot authenticate the
buyer's identity. The buyer is obligated to deliver appropriate payment for items
purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fee Avoidance: The price stated in each item listing
description must be an accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may not add
supplemental charges or fees to the sale price or otherwise avoid fees. You may not
alter the item's price after a sale for the purpose of avoiding Peerio transaction
fees, misrepresent the item's location, or use another user's account without
permission.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">6. Content</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">License: Peerio does not claim ownership rights in your
Content. You grant Peerio a license solely to enable Peerio to use any information or
Content you supply Peerio with, so that Peerio is not violating any rights you might
have in that Content. You grant Peerio a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual,

Content on Peerio in any way as Peerio chooses. Peerio will only use personal
information in accordance with Peerio's Privacy Policy.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">As part of a transaction, you may obtain personal

physical mail list. For more information, see Peerio's Privacy Policy.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Re-Posting Content: By posting Content on Peerio, it is
possible for an outside website or a third party to re-post that Content. You agree to
hold Peerio harmless for any dispute concerning this use. If you choose to display your

listing page on Peerio.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Idea Submissions: Peerio considers any unsolicited
suggestions, ideas, proposals or other material submitted to it by users via the
Service or otherwise (other than the Content and the tangible items sold on the Service
by users) (collectively, the "Material") to be non-confidential and non-proprietary,
and Peerio shall not be liable for the disclosure or use of such Material. If, at
Peerio's request, any member sends Material to improve the site (for example through
the Forums or to customer support), Peerio will also consider that Material to be
non-confidential and non-proprietary and Peerio will not be liable for use or
disclosure of the Material. Any communication by you to Peerio is subject to this
Agreement. You hereby grant and agree to grant Peerio, under all of your rights in the
Material, a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully-paid,
sublicensable and transferable right and license to incorporate, use, publish and
exploit such Material for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, including
but not limited to incorporating it in the API, documentation, or any product or
service, without compensation or accounting to you and without further recourse by you.
So there's that.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">7. Information Control</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peerio does not control the Content provided by users
that is made available on Peerio. You may find some Content to be offensive, harmful,
inaccurate, or deceptive. There are also risks of dealing with underage persons or
people acting under false pretense.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additionally, there may also be risks dealing with
international trade and foreign nationals. By using Peerio, you agree to accept such
risks and that Peerio (and Peerio's officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint
ventures, pets, and employees) is not responsible for any and all acts or omissions of
users on Peerio. Please use caution, common sense, and practice safe buying and selling
when using Peerio.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">8. Meetings</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Users may arrange and attend online virtual meetings or
in-person meetings ("Meetings") with one or more individuals. Users are solely
responsible for interactions with others. Users must comply with Peerio's policies and
acknowledge and agree to comply with the laws of the city, county and country in which
the Meeting occurs.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peerio does not supervise or control the Meetings,
user-initiated online or offline gatherings, or the interactions among and between
users and other persons or companies. Users are solely responsible for interactions
with others. Users understand that Peerio does not in any way screen its users. All
users agree to exercise caution and good judgment in all interactions with others,
particularly if meeting offline or in person.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">9. Item Receipt and Refunds</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">All users share the responsibility for making sure that
purchases facilitated by Peerio are satisfactory and hassle-free.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Payment: As a buyer, your credit card is charged
immediately for the full offer amount after filling out the appropriate payment
information.</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class=
"c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pickup: Buyers have 48 hours to coordinate the pick up
of the item before the seller may cancel the sale, refunding the purchase price to the
original payment method. Sellers are responsible for making themselves available to
buyers to pick up items, within reason, during the times they specified in the pickup
availability section of the respective item listings.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Item acceptance: Once both parties agree that the sale
is complete, the seller may request payment from Peerio, prompting confirmation from
the buyer that the item has been received and accepted, as-is. A text message
confirming item acceptance is then sent to the buyer, or the buyer may accept the item
by confirming receipt in the app. Buyers must inspect the condition of the item and
ONLY accept the item if it is as described in the item listing. By confirming, the
buyer agrees to pay the sale amount according to their card issuer agreement. Once an
item has been accepted, the item may not be returned to the seller and is not eligible
for refund.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Refunds: In some cases, buyers and sellers may not be
able to coordinate the pickup of an item within a reasonable amount of time or, despite
a seller's positive intentions, some material information may be left out of an item's
description. If an item is not as described or was not received, buyers should NOT
accept the item. If an item has already been accepted, only with the seller's express
consent will a refund be granted. Eligible refunds can be requested in Peerio and will,
if approved, made by crediting the payment method used.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">10. Resolution of Disputes and Release</span></p>

within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is
permanently barred.</span></p>

<p class="c1 c2"></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Should you have a dispute with one or more users, or an
outside party, you release Peerio (and Peerio's officers, directors, agents,
subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from any and all claims, demands and
damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown,
